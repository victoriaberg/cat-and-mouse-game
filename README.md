# Cat & Mouse Game

A 2D tile-based game developed in Java as a school project. This project demonstrates strong proficiency in Object-Oriented Design (OOD) and handling low-level game mechanics, including user input and collision logic.


## Key Features

* **Platform Implementation:** Designed and developed the application window and graphical interface using Java Swing and MigLayout.
* **Object-Oriented Design (OOD):** Implemented a modular and clean architecture where the game logic is strictly separated into dedicated modules (e.g., `Entity`, `TileManager`, `CollisionControll`).
* **Advanced Game Logic:** Implemented core game mechanics including complex tile-based collision handling to manage player/mouse interaction with the game environment.
* **Resource Management:** Utilized Gson for structured data handling (e.g., map configuration or data persistence).


## How to Run

This project requires a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 17 or higher recommended).

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
    ```
2.  **Open in IDE:** Open the project in a Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended).
3.  **Configure Libraries:** Ensure the necessary external libraries (MigLayout and Gson) are included in the project's build path (or configured via Maven/Gradle if applicable). (Note: These libraries are located in the `/libs` directory of the project.)
4.  **Run Main Class:** Execute the `Main.java` class located in the `src/se/liu/vicbe988/background` package.
